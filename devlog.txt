  To-Do List

5-29-2014
  Changed Card from an interface to a super class
  Made new classes (NewRule, Hand) and edited old ones to fit the above change
  Changed To Do List to fit Hand and Board
  
05-30-2014
  Coded Hand and edit discard (removed discard from discard)
  Edit subclass of superclass Card
  Created Table
  
06-02-2014
  Recreated the UML diagram 
    Before Card was an interface now it's changed to a superclass 
    Also added to the original diagram (Deck, Discard, Table,Hand)
  Added to the Table class (Hand getPlayer)
  Try to tested out Deck

  Worked out the basic moves that a player is allowed to do(play,discard,draw)
  Tested the cases and it all seems to work so far
  Need to think of a good way to implement the newRules, Goals,etc effects
  -Recovered almost fully from my cold-
  
06-13-2014
  updated the basic moves and allow user to inout what cards they want to play/discard
  set a counter for amount of times one can draw/play
  finish setting up the basic of a board
  
06-15-2014 (morning)
  fixed the play and discard to ensure that a player only plays/discards what he has in his hand
  change play/discard to read in an index for a card instead of card name
  
06-15-2014 (afternoon and on)
